title: The Tilting of Startup Economics
---

tl;dr *low marginal costs of production favor large companies. low distribution costs favors startups. As costs of distribution rise, the balance tilts again startups.*

A tech startup is a company designed to become a monopoly.[^1]

In software, there are two outcomes: be a standard or be a commodity. This is because in software, marginal cost of bits goes *immediately* to zero. In a competitive environment, prices and profits are near zero.

However, once you've become a standard, you can charge whatever the customer is willing (and able) to pay. Just ask Microsoft, Adobe, Autodesk, Intuit, or Salesforce. Once you're a standard, you've built something that requires years of marketing, distribution, and sales to duplicate.

The race to get there is brutal. Any whiff of success creates an army of well-funded competitors, some of them unabashed clones from much larger corporations[^2]. Larger or well-funded competitors can lower prices to zero (or below zero) to crush out competition, commodify your product, and turn it into their product's feature moat. The most famous case was Internet Explorer. Microsoft never charged consumers for it, Netscape's demise ensure Window's preeminence as a software platform for years.

How have startups been able to compete against the behemoths? By growing faster than your competitors can commodify you. There is alway some lag between growth, and the market recognizing it.[^3] This window allows some products to become a standard and you achieve a monopoly before larger companies can react.

What allows a company to grow faster than competitors can react? Two things: 1. The means of production and 2. The means of distribution.

For production, open source software has continuously lowered the cost of making new software. AWS has lowered the cost of scaling it. This has changed, as many of today's large companies have very modern software stacks and their own means of scaling new internal products.

The means of distribution have also experience some step function changes. Broadband made distributing software free via web apps. Mobile devices expanded the reach of software outside of the office. For many years, the massive growth of the Internet meant that tech startups only had to build great products. Word-of-mouth and the natural overwhelming growth of the Internet carried them forward faster than incumbents could react.

Slowly but surely, the Internet is becoming a more and more crowded place. Because the means of discovery are increasingly owned a handful of companies (Google, Facebook, Apple), marketing/distribution has become part of every product's growth story. Startups are often more strapped for resources, precluding them from buying users.

For a while startups sustained themselves by making marketing and distribution *part of the product*. Dropbox gave away referral space. Zynga made their product inherently viral. Yet, as referral incentives rise due to competitive pressue, they increasingly look like paid marketing. The problem with paid marketing for growth is that it is inherently linear instead of exponential. Linear growth always biases towards well-funded, large companies because linear growth is easily projected, planned, and financed.

This isn't to say that this is the end of startups (though, I'm biased, given that I'm working for [Sentry](https://getsentry.com)). I do agree it is only going to get harder and only startups with some implicit advantage in production or distribution will to survive.
