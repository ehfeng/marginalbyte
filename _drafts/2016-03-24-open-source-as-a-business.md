title: Open Source as a Business

All developer tools will eventually be open source. Two decades ago, this might have seemed impossible. A decade ago, possible but not inevitable. Today, it seems inevitable.

To be clear, I don't believe open source software is magically superior. 99.9% of open source users don't contribute back, and open source contributors aren't inherently better or more productive. Open source's inevitability stems from its distribution — namely how developers find and use their tools.

When a developer considers a new tool, only two questions matter.

1. Does it solve today's problem?
2. How much will it cost to maintain?

While there are other questions — *Do I like the design? Does someone I respect recommend this software? Do they use my favorite programming language?* — these pale in comparison.

### 1. Does it solve today's problem?

Proprietary software can solve the problem just as well as open source, sometimes with a better designed UI or dedicated account rep. Yet, open source wins every time because it is free: both free-of-charge and free of unwanted sales calls before you've even decided whether *it solves your problem.*

Trials and freemium help with this, but still raise the next question...

### 2. How much will it cost to maintain?

Proprietary software is out of your control. Changes in functionality or pricing.
Open source


Early on, you'd rather save $100. But once your software is used by thousands if not millions, you'd rather save 10 hours.



General suspicion of Twitter's API

Not everything will nor should be open source. **Open source is a feature, not a philosophy.** Would people take better photos if Instagram was open source? Would open source Fallout be a better game? Probably not. Interestingly, developer IDEs don't necessarily benefit.


Python isn't popular because people loved Python. It's popular because it solved people's problem and was cheap and easy to get started. I learned Python because of Django.

Why would anyone pay for a product like [Sentry](https://getsentry.com), which is 100% open source, when they can use it for free?

The answer is "support and services", which inherently has worse margins and differentiation than proprietary software businesses like Microsoft Office.

In [New Relic's IPO docs](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1448056/000119312514406260/d709327ds1.htm), 63% of operating expenses were sales and marketing. The rest is split between product development and administrative expenses.

Aside from being an open source project, Sentry is also a business. Why, then.



Open source means free forever.

There's a lot of things that are free. But free doesn't mean
